## Wait what do you mean "planned"?

Unfortunately, I cannot find a Raspberry Pi anywhere, but I am planning on making some awesome things when I can get my hands on one. I wanted to post it here just so I can have this as a to-do list, and so you can see what I am thinking of doing. If I cannot find a raspberry pi I plan on just building a cheap pc to do some of these projects.
