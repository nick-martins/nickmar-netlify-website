#### Who am I?

As you know by now, my name is Nick Martins. I am a student at Carleton University and studying a Bachelor of Information Technology with a specialization in Network Technology. I have always been an extroverted person and love to get myself out there.  I am very goal-driven, a quick learner and like to solve challenges. Hopefully, some of my [projects](https://nickmartins.netlify.app/projects/) or [my blog](https://nickmartins.netlify.app/blog/) gave you some insight into who I am but here is a quick description anyways.

Other than obviously loving technology, especially information technology, I also really love playing video games, watching movies, hanging out with friends, anime, and most of all I love traveling. That probably does not come as a surprise just looking at the photos on this website. I also love tinkering with things, taking them apart, and putting them back together, and I love making new things. Programming is also something I really love and always want to learn new languages. One of the main reasons I wanted to make this website was to learn how to do HTML and CSS, and to figure out how to put it online without purchasing a domain.

Having a great work-life balance is important not only for myself but for every person, even you reading this. I think that if someone is happy with themselves outside of work then they can bring that positivity to their work. That is exactly what I strive for when it comes to work and my life. I want to succeed and I will always do everything I can, that's a promise.

I wanted to create this website (with help from a template of course) so I could practice HTML and CSS to see how web pages are built. I put this website on a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/nick-martins/nickmar-netlify-website), so anyone can see what is going on behind the scenes. This was a great learning experience and it is amazing that this bit of practice is now being put out there for people to see. If you want to learn more about me or just get in touch then feel free to use the contact form and I will get back to you as soon as possible.
