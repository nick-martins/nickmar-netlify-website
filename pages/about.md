#### Who am I?

As you know by now, my name is [Nick Martins](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickmartins/). I am a student at Carleton University and Algonquin College studying for a Bachelor of Information Technology with a specialization in Network Technology. Yes, you read that right, I am studying at two schools. My program allows me to get the university-level knowledge and college hands-on experience that can be considered an asset in many areas. I have always been an extroverted person and love to get myself out there. I've joined sports teams, clubs, and societies. I am a quick learner and a goal-driven student. I also love to solve challenges. Hopefully, some of my [projects](https://nickmartins.netlify.app/projects/) or [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickmartins/) gave you some insight into who I am but here is a quick description anyways.

Other than obviously loving technology, especially information technology, I also really love playing video games, watching movies, hanging out with friends, watching anime, and most of all I love traveling. That probably does not come as a surprise just by looking at the photos throughout this website. I also love tinkering with things, taking them apart, and putting them back together, and I love making new things. Programming is also something I really love and always want to learn new languages. One of the main reasons I wanted to make this website was to learn how to do HTML and CSS, and to figure out how to put it online without having to purchase a website hosting service. Since you're reading this it worked!

Having a great work-life balance is important not only for myself but for every person, even you reading this! I believe that if someone is happy with themselves outside of work then they can bring that positivity to their work. That is exactly what I strive for when it comes to work and my life.

As stated before, I wanted to create this website (with help from a [template](https://github.com/TylerMRoderick/fernfolio-11ty-template) of course) so I could practice HTML and CSS to see how web pages are built. I put this website on a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/nick-martins/nickmar-netlify-website), so anyone can see what is going on behind the scenes. This was a great learning experience and, amazingly, this bit of practice is now being put out there for people to see. It may not be all that special, but it is special to me. This is just the beginning of my tech journey and I am so glad you are here to witness the beginning.
