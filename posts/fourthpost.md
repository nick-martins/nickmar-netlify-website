Hello and welcome to the Tech Abyss Blog. I'm [Nickolas Martins](https://nickmartins.netlify.app/about/), but you can call me Nick. This is the first post on my new blog and just wanted to send you a quick welcome and thanks for coming!

### What's going on with this blog?

Well, I just wanted somewhere to put my thoughts and document my projects amongst other posts. I wanted to make this blog to also practice my writing skills since I know how vital it can be for my future, but I always neglect to do it so this gives me more purpose. 

### What do you plan on posting?

Other than just posting my documentation of my projects, I plan on posting about topics that I find very interesting. I always love keeping up with the latest tech and would love to just talk about it. I hope that you find this blog fun and informative.

Thanks for reading,

~Nick
