The world of technology is my home. At least that is what it feels like. I want to make the world more convenient and also a more exciting place, and that is where technology fits in. Technology makes the world more interesting by allowing us to do things that was never imaginable even only 50 years ago. This is why I want to spread that passion around and make people realize that there is more to the tech industry than just making money... I want to show people that there is a lot that people take for granted and that though it is easy to sit behind a computer and type, the real root for technology is communication. This is not to say that communication over the internet is not real communication, but having in-person feelings and conversations is extremely important as well... But these are just my thoughts...
